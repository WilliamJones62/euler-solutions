# README

This repository contains my coding solutions to the problems listed at https://projecteuler.net/archives. These problems are an opportunity to
practice coding solutions in Ruby to the kind of problems that may be presented at technical interviews. If you have any questions or comments about any of my solutions I would be happy to discuss them.
